    <h1 id="MyHeader">2007: Type to Learn</h1>

    <p id="desc2"> At my new school, I learned how to type in a program called "Type To Learn 3" which I ended up completing.
      In the program, a character called father time takes you in his time traveling machine into important historical events as you complete different fun games.
      It does get harder to complete the lessons once you progress with the game.
