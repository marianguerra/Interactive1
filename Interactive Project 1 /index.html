<p id="desc1"> I took a computers class in 2006 at my school where I had to take I typing program called Garfield's Typing Pal which I had a hard time completing the assignments.
  I remember that one of my inclass assginments,I had to create overlapping shapes in the Paint app and I also had fun playing aroudn with the different fonts that were included.

<p id="desc2"> At my new school, I learned how to type in a program called "Type To Learn 3" which I ended up completing.
  In the program, a character called father time takes you in his time traveling machine into important historical events as you complete different fun games.
  It does get harder to complete the lessons once you progress with the game.

<p id="desc3"> Around this time, I started playing Club Penguin which was an online virtual gaming world where you create a penguin
  character and have adventure at the penguin island. At the Club Penguin island, you can play job games where you can earn money and buy puffles (pets)
  clothes, and funiture for your igloo, if you pay for a membership. Some of my favorite games that I had my character participate in was doing top secret spy missions and competing with other players
  players at the Dojo doing elemental kung fu.
