<h2>Walnut Creek</h2>
<p class="desc"> Me and my family live in Walnut Creek which is a suburb that is close to Oakland. In 1849,the first settler was a man called William Slusher settled on a communnity called The Corners who later renamed the town Walnut Creek.
The town was named Walnut Creek because there is a creek that cuts through downtown. The towns population grew with the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1891 and the Sacramento Northern Railway. Walnut Creek contains more open space than any other community in California.
Today the town is known for its Shopping Center and many good restaurants. During the winter, when it gets super cold, sometimes you can see snow on the peak of Mt. Diablo. Walnut Creek is also the birthplace of actor Greg Sestero who appeared in the cult movie The Room.
